## Explanation

The beginning stage of each customer's onboarding procedure includes a trial plan. However, it remains uncertain whether this trial plan is determined by the customer's selection or if Foodie Fi has a predetermined default plan. From the provided sample, it's evident that one in every four customers which accounts for 25% of our total customers subscribed to the annual Pro plan subscription offered by Foodie Fi.

As indicated by our results, every customer initiates with a trial plan, as evidenced by all customers having a trial plan in their subscription. Subsequently, they make a decision to transition, either opting for our basic monthly plan or upgrading to the annual pro plan. This transition is observable in the data, with customer ID 11 standing out as a case of churn, having not upgraded to any of our plans.
